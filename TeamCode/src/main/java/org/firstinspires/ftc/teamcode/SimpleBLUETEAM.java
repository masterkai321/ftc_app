/**
 * This file illustrates the concept of driving up to a line and then stopping.
 * It uses the common Pushbot hardware class to define the drive on the robot.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * The code shows using two different light sensors:
 *   The Primary sensor shown in this code is a legacy NXT Light sensor (called "light sensor")
 *   Alternative "commented out" code uses a MR Optical Distance Sensor (called "sensor_ods")
 *   instead of the LEGO sensor.  Chose to use one sensor or the other.
 *
 *   Setting the correct WHITE_THRESHOLD value is key to stopping correctly.
 *   This should be set half way between the light and dark values.
 *   These values can be read on the screen once the OpMode has been INIT, but before it is STARTED.
 *   Move the senso on asnd off the white line and not the min and max readings.
 *   Edit this code to make WHITE_THRESHOLD half way between the min and max.
 *
 * Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
